# Python-Challenge - The Python Analysis of .csv files

## Introduction

This is an analysis of two .csv files using Python. These .csv files are large and unorganized, but the Python analysis is used to get statistical results out of the messy files.

## Instruction

In this analysis, the following two folders are created:

[PyBank](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/python-challenge/tree/main/PyBank)
<br>
[PyPoll](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/python-challenge/tree/main/PyBank)


*Each* of the above folders includes three files:
- **main.py** 
    - This is the file that contains the main script to run for each analysis.
- **Resources** folder
    - This folder contains the CSV file.
- **analysis** folder
    - This folder contains the **analysis.txt** file that has the results from each Python analysis.
